Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that primarily affects the small air sacs known as alveoli. Common symptoms include a productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity of pneumonia can vary. It is typically caused by infections with viruses or bacteria, and less frequently by other microorganisms, certain medications, or conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, impaired ability to cough (e.g., following a stroke), and a weakened immune system. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination, with chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum cultures aiding in confirmation.

This mini project focuses on developing a classification model to identify pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

**Dataset Name**: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

**Number of Records**: 5,856

**Description**: The dataset is organized into three folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-ray images (JPEG) and two categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged one to five years from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of the patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest X-ray images, all radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing low-quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being used to train the AI system. To account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also reviewed by a third expert.
